# nba-players-kaggle-project
nba project from kaggle data science

# This project is divided into 2 parts. apple visualization and nba dataset from kaggle.

## The first part: apple visualization
First I understand the data by using the info and describe functions.
Then I show some of graphs by using matplotlib and sea-born. 
This notebook focus more in the free and paid apps and their differences.

## The second part: nba data-set
First, as I did in the apple data-set, I understart the data and use info and describe function to get to know it better.
Then, I show some graphs to get some insights on the data and the players in it.
Later I use the hight wight ratio to check if it have any influence on the players stats.
For the last part of the notebook I preper out data.
I saw that the draft_year draft_round and draft_number columns are string and not integers so I changed it.
After doing that and the dumies section I scaled each column and start importing anything I need for out models.
I run some models on our data and got some good results
